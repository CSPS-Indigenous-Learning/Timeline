            <p>South, Central, and North America have been inhabited by a diverse range of peoples for thousands of years. Population estimates for these continents prior to the earliest arrival of Europeans vary widely—from a low of 8 million to a high of 112 million people. These numbers encompassed hundreds of distinct and sophisticated nations, cultures, languages, and economies. The Aztec capital—now known as Mexico City—had a population of 250 000 people, which was four times more than London, England, at that time.</p>
