            <p>The continents now known as South and North America have been occupied by diverse peoples for thousands of years. Population estimates for the two continents prior to the earliest arrival of Europeans vary widely, from a low of 8 million to a high of 112 million. No matter what the actual numbers, there were hundreds of distinct and sophisticated nations, cultures, languages and economies.</p>
            <p>For example, when the first Europeans arrived, the Aztec capital (now known as Mexico City) had a population of 250,000. That was four times the population of London, England, in the same era.</p>
            <p>Approximately 70 distinct <a href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-58">Indigenous languages</a>, comprising 10 separate language families, have existed since time immemorial. Today, Indigenous Peoples are working to revitalize and sustain their languages, which have decreased in use in recent generations. </p>
            <p>However, Indigenous languages are still spoken widely. In Nunavut, the official languages are the Inuit language (Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun), English and French. As for the Northwest Territories, nine of the eleven official languages are Indigenous and they belong to three different language families: Dene, Inuit and Cree.</p>
